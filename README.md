# Witch Hunter

Witch Hunter: A Multiplayer Horror Game is developed to present an entaining and exciting
horror game. It is inspired by medieval beliefs that demons can shape-shift into various
animals and reside in the dark, eerie forests.

In this game, players are divided into two factions: the Witch Hunters and the Witch.
The Witch Hunters must work together to survive and perform rituals to eliminate the Witch.
They must capture demonized deers, using sacred knives and traps. Then, they must use the
captured deersâ€™ blood to perform rituals. Meanwhile, the Witch aims to hinder and deceive
the opposing faction by transforming into demonized deers and using magic to attack.

The game is developed using Unreal Engine to immerse players in a realistic experience
through a first-person perspective. It presents an exciting and frightening experience.
